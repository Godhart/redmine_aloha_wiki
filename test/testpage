h1. About this page

This page is intended for WYSIWYG tests. It contains features to test and also it contains TODO list.
To test all features presented on this pages by yourself (using Redmine of course) you'll need to add project objects, referenced from this page (see wikis and images links below)

There is three subjects of concern in this WYSIWYG plugin:
# *WYSIWYG content* is made right by native Redmine engine (used version 1.4 code with just a little tuning) so it looks like it would actually look after publishing.
# *WYSIWYG editor* features are all about "Aloha-editor":http://aloha-editor.org and it's plugins capabilities. It's lacks some functionality yet (see TODOs below) but basics do fine.
It's a main source of WYSIWYG score.
# *HTML to textile conversion* as WYSIWYG editor operates with HTML code. It's done on server side by a "special conversion plugin":https://github.com/Godhart/redmine_conv_htmltotextile.
The less textile content changes when toggling editor textile->WYSIWYG->textile, the greater overall WYSIWYG score is.

h2. Head Tag

Generic Head Tag: <h\d>, but 1-6 levels used only

h3. Header 3

h4. Header 4

h5. Header 5

h6. Header 6

h2. Formating and TOC

*Bold* Tag: <srtong> _*NOTE:* HTML conversion engine also uses <b> tag to avoid Bold/Strong ambiguity made by WYSIWYG_

_Italic_ Tag: <em> _*NOTE:* HTML conversion engine also uses <i>  tag to avoid Emphasis/Italic ambiguity made by WYSIWYG_

+Underline+ Tag: <ins>

-Deleted- Tag: <del> _*NOTE:* HTML conversion engine also uses <s> and <strike> tags as WYSIWYG uses them instead_

??Quote?? Tag: <cite>

Sub/super script: How about ^this^ and ~that~ ?

@Inline Code@ Tag: <codE>, Ignore other inner tags (that could come from Coderay et.c) *TODO:* <codE> tag to @ for single liners

<pre> Tag: <prE>, Ignore other inner tags (that could come from Coderay et.c)
Preformated

_*NOTE:* since textilizable_wysiwyg is in use no need for processing this tag, but support for this still remains in the html-to-textile conversion engine_

h2. Links tests goes below

[[a_link_to_wiki|Wiki link]] Tag:<a class="wiki-page
[[Test2:a_link_to_outer_wiki|Outer Wiki link]] Tag:<a class="wiki-page. *NOTE:* you should have 'test2' project to see this working

BALLOON(That's how balloons works - need ACRONYM)

"balloon link (it's balloon)":http://balloon.com Balloon for http link is made by putting (blablabla) within alternate text. That's balloon is identified by 'title' tag within <a href= ... tag

[[Test2:Wiki#Anchor|Wiki BALLOON(Balloon!)]] That balloon within WIKI link is about ACRONYM too *TODO:* anymore balloons?

http://www.ballon.com (try to do another one balloon) *TODO:* Is there a way do balloons just like this?

Issue #12 Tag: *TODO:* Check that it still works

Revision r43 Tag: *TODO:* Check that it still works

{{include(includetest)}}
_*NOTE:* it's impossible to process this in html-to-textile conversion engine with current approach to WYSIWYG content generation, but since textilizable_wysiwyg is in use there is no need anymore for processing this at all_

h2. HTML Conversion engine TODO

* check all anchors processing
** seems to be done - just do some tests
* bold/italic/etc within word. Mine redmine can't do this. And Yours?
* formated blocks like this one: _*bold within italic* just italic_ are failed (italic disappears after textile->wysiwyg->textile)

h2. WYSIWYG Editor engine TODO

* Aloha wiki currently lacks of some features like those listed below. They are to be added into aloha (soon or later)
** underline
** wiki link
** wiki image
** quote
** code
** remove ambiguous Bold/Strong Italic/Emphasis buttons from menu
** alignment (It has it but won't works for me). P.S.: probably that is required least
** abbreviation (I call it Balloon on this page as it pop-ups like this in my browser :) ).
P.S.: Actually it's there in Aloha but need to tune html-to-textile conversion engine to make it work

* As WYSIWYG is currently in test stage it's required to convert to textile before saving
** Link to convert to textile is located on top of page. It would be nice to have conversion button on WYSIWYG editor menu

h2. Other TODO

* TODOs that are scattered within text on that page
* Backspace doesn't works when Aloha is turned on for some reason (works fine with just html5 contenteditable)
** check previous or newer versions - example on http://aloha-editor.org/ have no such issues
